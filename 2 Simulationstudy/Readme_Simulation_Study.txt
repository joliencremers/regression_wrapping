#Generating simulated data
All simutation data can be generated by running ./Simulated_data/Data_generator.R
Note that to save space the input files are not included in this archive.

#Running the regression analyses
First the Ccode needs to be compiled. Instructions can be found in ./Ccodes_and_scripts/Compiling.txt
For each simulation study there is a shell script in ./Ccodes_and_scripts. Make sure to change dir into
./Ccodes_and_scripts before calling them. Output will be written to ./Simulation_output
.

#Analysing output data
To check convergence the file ./Check trace plots.R can be used. 
To check autocorrelations the file ./Check autocorrelation plots.R can be used. 
The file ./Analysis.R can be used to calculate all values in Tables 1 to 3 and Figures 6 to 8.
